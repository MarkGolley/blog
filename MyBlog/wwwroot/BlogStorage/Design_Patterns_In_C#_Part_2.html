<h1>Design Patterns Part 2</h1>

<h4>Repository</h4>
<p>
    This one properly clicked for me. You create a repository interface that defines what you need (add, find, update), then a concrete class implements it.
    Your service takes the interface via DI so the implementation details are kept out of the way. The main benefit, as I see it, is that you can swap
    implementations later (different databases, in-memory for tests, and so on) without rewriting the service itself.
</p>

<h4>Strategy</h4>
<p>
    This was an interesting one. You inject behaviour into a class instead of hard-coding it. The example I saw was a payment service that needs to handle
    different payment types. You define an interface such as <code>Pay()</code>, then create implementations (PayPal, Apple Pay, and so on). When you construct
    the service, you pass in the strategy you want. If you find yourself writing lots of <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code> branches to vary behaviour,
    a strategy is often a cleaner approach.

<h4>StringBuilder</h4>
<p>
    This is a more efficient way to build strings because concatenation creates a new string each time. I had seen <code>StringBuilder</code> before but never
    really used it. I like that you can <code>Append()</code> repeatedly (and there are other useful methods such as <code>Clear()</code> and <code>Replace()</code>).
    For short strings I still tend to use <code>+</code>, but in loops or when building something larger this feels more appropriate.
</p>

<h4>Char vs String</h4>
<p>
    I had not really thought about the distinction before: <code>'A'</code> is a <strong>char</strong> and <code>"A"</code> is a <strong>string</strong>.
    In Python and JavaScript there is no distinction between single and double quotes, so this caught me out in C#.
    I am trying to be more deliberate about it now.
