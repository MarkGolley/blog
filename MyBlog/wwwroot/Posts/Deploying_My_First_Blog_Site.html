<h1>Deploying My .NET Blog to Render</h1>

<p>Recently, I set out to publish my personal .NET blog using <a href="https://render.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Render</a>, a platform I hadn’t used before but one that looked appealing for simple web hosting. Things didn’t go entirely smoothly. Here’s a recap of what went wrong, what I learned, and what eventually got me over the finish line.</p>

<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>I’d built a simple ASP.NET Core MVC blog project with a controller to serve my blog posts from HTML files. All I wanted was to get it hosted somewhere easily and Render seemed like a good option. It <em>was</em>, but only after some trial and error.</p>

<h2>Attempt 1: Native .NET - Static Site</h2>
<p>Initially, I followed Render’s static Web Service guide. The default build command I was using looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet publish MyBlog/MyBlog.csproj -c Release -o out</code></pre>
<p>But this failed with:</p>
<pre><code>bash: line 1: dotnet: command not found</code></pre>
<p>Basically, Render's docs suggest using their Static Site option for blogs, sounded good right? Even though Render says their Static Site is "great for blogs", it's meant only for blogs built entirely with static HTML, CSS, and JS files — no backend code like C#, no .NET, no dynamic rendering. There in lay the problem.</p>

<h2>Attempt 2: Docker Deployment - Dynamic Site</h2>
<p>A dynamic site with Render fully supports server-side code and building from a dockerfile, so well suited to my c# ASP.NET core app.</p>
<p>I wrote a <code>Dockerfile</code> that used the official .NET 8 SDK image, published the app, and exposed port 80.</p>
<p>I also added a <code>render.yaml</code> file to tell Render how to build and deploy the app using Docker. Once this was in place, Render successfully built and ran the app. But.....</p>

<h2>A Mysterious "Not Found"</h2>
<p>Even though the app deployed, if i visited the URL i just got a <strong>"Not Found"</strong> page. It wasn’t a 404 page from my app — it was Render’s own page.</p>
<p>After digging in, I realized I’d left in some non-standard code from a .NET 9 preview template I’d previously experimented with. Once I removed them and stuck with the conventional middleware setup (<code>UseStaticFiles()</code>, <code>MapControllerRoute()</code>, etc.), everything worked as expected.</p>

<h2>Success!</h2>
<p>After cleaning up the Docker file and reverting my <code>Program.cs</code> to the basic methods the site deployed correctly - I finally saw something other than “Not Found”.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you're deploying a .NET app to Render, go for their 'Web Services' type of site, use Docker, stick with .NET 8, and use basic syntax unless you’re absolutely sure it will work!</p>
