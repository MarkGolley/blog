<h1>Why I Set Up a Pi-hole and How I Got It Working</h1>

<p>I‚Äôd read about the benefits of a Pi-hole and how it could reduce the number of ads I see across all my devices on Wi-Fi. I already use browser ad blockers, but I wanted to experiment with a Raspberry Pi‚Äîand this seemed like the perfect project!</p>

<p>Enter Pi-hole: a powerful little tool that runs as a local DNS server, blocking ads for every device on your network.</p>

<h2>Why I Got a Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Ads had become more intrusive than ever, especially on streaming services, YouTube, and certain websites. I wanted:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Faster browsing</strong> (if possible)</li>
    <li><strong>Fewer distractions</strong> ‚Äì yes please (haha)</li>
    <li><strong>More privacy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Some nerdy fun</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a spare Raspberry Pi 3 from a friend, so I decided to put it to work.</p>

<h2>The Network Flow</h2>
<p>Here's how network traffic flows after setting it up:</p>
<p><code>Device ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí Internet</code></p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>Before I could begin, I needed a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HDMI to Micro HDMI cable</li>
    <li>USB-A keyboard</li>
    <li>USB-A mouse ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have one, so it was keyboard-only!</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Does a Pi Connect?</h3>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt even sure if my Pi supported Wi-Fi. To find out, I ran:</p>
<pre><code>iwconfig</code></pre>
<p>I looked for <code>wlan0</code> in the output‚Äîand it was there! So Wi-Fi was a go.</p>

<h2>Installing Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Installation was simple with a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code></pre>
<p>I selected a few popular blocklists and configured Pi-hole to run on port 8080, since another service was already using port 80.</p>

<h3>Connecting Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>To get Wi-Fi working, I edited the network configuration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></pre>
<p>Then added:</p>
<pre class="blueprint">network={
    ssid="YourWiFiSSID"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword"
}</pre>
<p>After a quick reboot, I got the IP address using:</p>
<pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: Assign a static IP to your Pi using your router‚Äôs admin settings.
</div>

<h3>Telling the Router to Use the Pi-hole</h3>
<p>I logged into my router (the default IP and password were printed on the back), and changed the DNS settings from "automatic" to "manual". Then I entered the Pi‚Äôs IP address so it could handle DNS requests.</p>

<h4>What is DNS Resolution?</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs how your devices translate human-friendly domain names (like <code>bbc.co.uk</code>) into IP addresses. Pi-hole steps in here to block unwanted domains at this point in the process.</p>

<h2>Taking a Look at the Dashboard</h2>
<p>To access the dashboard, I visited:</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.1.XXX/admin</code></pre>
<p>It loaded‚Äîbut there was zero activity showing. Uh-oh.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Why It Was Inactive</h2>
<p>After digging into the dashboard settings, I saw that it was using the Ethernet interface. I needed to switch it to use Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pihole -r</code></pre>
<p>But it skipped the configuration menu, so I instead edited:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/pihole/setupVars.conf</code></pre>
<p>And changed:</p>
<pre><code>PIHOLE_INTERFACE=wlan0</code></pre>

<p>After a restart, I tested DNS resolution with:</p>
<pre><code>nslookup bbc.co.uk 192.168.1.XXX</code></pre>
<p>Still no luck. I checked if DNS was running with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo netstat -tulnp | grep ":53"</code></pre>
<p>It was listening‚Äîbut only locally.</p>

<p>I then tried pinging the Pi from my PC:</p>
<pre><code>ping 192.168.1.XXX</code></pre>
<p>That worked. From the Pi I ran:</p>
<pre><code>dig bbc.co.uk @127.0.0.1
dig bbc.co.uk @192.168.1.XXX</code></pre>
<p>The first worked, but the second didn‚Äôt. So I edited the Pi-hole DNS config:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/01-pihole.conf</code></pre>
<p>And added:</p>
<pre class="blueprint">listen-address=127.0.0.1
listen-address=192.168.1.XXX</pre>
<p>After that‚Äîsuccess! Pi-hole was now ready to accept DNS queries from the network.</p>

<h2>Making Devices Use Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I routed devices through it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Windows PC</strong>: Updated DNS manually in Ethernet settings</li>
    <li><strong>iPhone & Apple TV</strong>: Changed DNS under their Wi-Fi settings</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: It takes effect instantly‚Äîno need to reboot the device.
</div>

<p>Once configured, ads started vanishing across those devices.</p>

<h2>Blocklists and Limitations</h2>
<p>Out of the box, Pi-hole doesn‚Äôt block YouTube ads, ITVX ads, or adult content. That‚Äôs not a bug‚Äîit‚Äôs because these services often serve content and ads from the same domains.</p>

<p>To strengthen Pi-hole, I added:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Firebog list collection</li>
    <li>Steven Black‚Äôs hosts file</li>
</ul>

<p>Even then, YouTube remains tricky‚ÄîDNS-level blocking has limits.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Setting up Pi-hole wasn‚Äôt totally smooth, but it was a fun and rewarding weekend project. I learned loads‚Äîabout DNS, firewalls, SMB sharing, and more.</p>

<p>My internet is now cleaner, faster, and more private. If you‚Äôre comfortable using the terminal and enjoy a bit of tinkering, I‚Äôd absolutely recommend giving Pi-hole a go.</p>

<h2>Bonus Project: Turn Pi into a Media Server</h2>
<p>With Pi-hole sorted, I plugged in an external hard drive full of movies and photos. It auto-mounted, so I could browse the files straight away.</p>

<p>I set up Samba (SMB) to access them from my Windows PC. I‚Äôm now trying to use Kodi on my Xbox to stream the content. The only snag: the ‚ÄúWindows network‚Äù option isn‚Äôt showing up. Still working on that!</p>

<p>Let me know if you've had a similar experience‚Äîor any tips for getting Kodi working with SMB. üòÑ</p>
