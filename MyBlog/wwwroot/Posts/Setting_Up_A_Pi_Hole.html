<h1>Why I Set Up a Pi-hole and How I Got It Working</h1>
<p> This post is a simple guide to setting up a Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi. I'll explain what the Pi-hole does, how to install it, and how it can improve your network experience.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd read about the benefits of a Pi-hole and how it could reduce the number of ads I see across all my devices on Wi-Fi. I already use browser ad blockers, but I wanted to experiment with a Raspberry Pi‚Äîand this seemed like the perfect project!</p>

<p>Enter Pi-hole: a powerful little tool that runs as a local DNS server, blocking ads for every device on your network.</p>

<h2>Why I Got a Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Ads had become more intrusive than ever, especially on streaming services, YouTube, and certain websites. I wanted:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Faster browsing</strong> (if possible)</li>
    <li><strong>Fewer distractions</strong> ‚Äì yes please (haha)</li>
    <li><strong>More privacy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Some nerdy fun</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a spare Raspberry Pi 3 from a friend, so I decided to put it to work.</p>

<h2>The Network Flow</h2>
<p>Here's how network traffic flows after setting it up:</p>
<p><code>Device ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí Internet</code></p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>Before I could begin, I needed a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HDMI to Micro HDMI cable</li>
    <li>USB-A keyboard</li>
    <li>USB-A mouse ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have one, so it was keyboard-only!</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Does a Pi Connect?</h3>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt even sure if my Pi supported Wi-Fi. To find out, I ran:</p>
<pre><code>iwconfig</code></pre>
<p>I looked for <code>wlan0</code> in the output‚Äîand it was there! So Wi-Fi was a go.</p>

<h2>Installing Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Installation was simple with a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code></pre>
<p>I selected a few popular blocklists and configured Pi-hole to run on port 8080, since another service was already using port 80.</p>

<h3>Connecting Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>To get Wi-Fi working, I edited the network configuration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></pre>
<p>Then added:</p>
<pre class="blueprint">network={
    ssid="YourWiFiSSID"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword"
}</pre>
<p>After a quick reboot, I got the IP address using:</p>
<pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: Assign a static IP to your Pi using your router‚Äôs admin settings.
</div>

<h3>Telling the Router to Use the Pi-hole</h3>
<p>I logged into my router (the default IP and password were printed on the back), and changed the DNS settings from "automatic" to "manual". Then I entered the Pi‚Äôs IP address so it could handle DNS requests.</p>

<h4>What is DNS Resolution?</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs how your devices translate human-friendly domain names (like <code>bbc.co.uk</code>) into IP addresses. Pi-hole steps in here to block unwanted domains at this point in the process.</p>

<h2>Taking a Look at the Dashboard</h2>
<p>To access the dashboard, I visited:</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.1.XXX/admin</code></pre>
<p>It loaded‚Äîbut there was zero activity showing. Uh-oh. Here is what a working one looks like:</p>
<img src="./Posts/PostsImages/pi-dashboard.png" alt="Pi-hole dashboard showing blocked ads statistics" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">

<h2>Diagnosing Why It Was Inactive</h2>
<p>When I first accessed the Pi-hole dashboard at:</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.1.XXX/admin</code></pre>
<p>It loaded, but there was zero activity showing. Uh-oh. I realized there might be an issue with how the Pi-hole was set up, so I decided to investigate. Here's what I did and why:</p>

<h3>1. Checking the Pi-hole Service</h3>
<p>First, I checked if the Pi-hole service itself was running. If it wasn‚Äôt, that would explain the inactivity. I used:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status pihole-FTL.service</code></pre>
<p>This command shows the current status of the Pi-hole's DNS resolver. I was looking for "active (running)" in the output. If it's inactive, it might mean Pi-hole failed to start due to a configuration error.</p>

<h3>2. Verifying the DNS Settings</h3>
<p>Next, I checked my router to confirm it was correctly configured to forward DNS queries to the Pi-hole. If the router isn‚Äôt pointing to the Pi's address as the DNS server, the devices on the network won't send their queries to the Pi-hole.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs why this is critical: without the router directing traffic to the Pi-hole, it can't filter or block anything. I logged into the router‚Äôs admin panel (usually found at <code>192.168.1.1</code>) and set the Pi-hole's IP <code>192.168.1.XXX</code> as the primary DNS server.</p>

<h3>3. Testing DNS Resolution</h3>
<p>To see if the Pi-hole was handling DNS queries, I ran a test from one of my devices. On my computer, I opened the terminal and used:</p>
<pre><code>nslookup google.com</code></pre>
<p>If the output didn‚Äôt show my Pi-hole‚Äôs IP address as the DNS server, it meant something was wrong with how DNS traffic was being routed. This test is crucial because it quickly determines if DNS requests are reaching the Pi-hole.</p>

<h3>4. Checking the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs IP Address</h3>
<p>Lastly, I confirmed that the Pi still had the correct IP address. Even though I assigned a static IP from the router, I used this command to verify:</p>
<pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>
<p>If the Pi‚Äôs IP had changed, none of my DNS settings would work. That‚Äôs why assigning a static IP to the Pi earlier in the setup is so important‚Äîit prevents accidental misrouting.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>After these checks, I found that the router hadn‚Äôt saved the DNS configuration properly the first time. Reapplying the settings resolved the issue, and within moments, the Pi-hole dashboard started showing blocked ads!</p>

<h2>Making Devices Use Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I routed devices through it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Windows PC</strong>: Updated DNS manually in Ethernet settings</li>
    <li><strong>iPhone & Apple TV</strong>: Changed DNS under their Wi-Fi settings</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: It takes effect instantly‚Äîno need to reboot the device.
</div>

<p>Once configured, ads started vanishing across those devices.</p>

<h2>Blocklists and Limitations</h2>
<p>Out of the box, Pi-hole doesn‚Äôt block YouTube/ITVX etc ads. That‚Äôs not a bug‚Äîit‚Äôs because these services often serve content and ads from the same domains.</p>

<p>To strengthen Pi-hole, I added a few more URLs to the dashboards block list and updated the pi to use them with
<pre><code>pihole -g</code></pre>
<p>I added:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Firebog list collection</li>
    <li>Steven Black‚Äôs hosts file</li>
</ul>

<p>Even then, YouTube remains tricky‚ÄîDNS-level blocking has limits.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Setting up Pi-hole wasn‚Äôt totally smooth, but it was a fun and rewarding weekend project. I learned loads doing this!!</p>

<p>My internet is now cleaner, faster, and more private. If you‚Äôre comfortable using the terminal and enjoy a bit of tinkering, I‚Äôd absolutely recommend giving Pi-hole a go.</p>

<h2>Bonus Project: Turn Pi into a Media Server</h2>
<p>With Pi-hole sorted, I plugged in an external hard drive full of movies and photos. It auto-mounted, so I could browse the files straight away.</p>

<p>I set up Samba (SMB) to access them from my Windows PC. I‚Äôm now trying to use Kodi on my Xbox to stream the content. The only snag: the ‚ÄúWindows network‚Äù option isn‚Äôt showing up. Still working on that!</p>

<p>Let me know if you've had a similar experience‚Äîor any tips for getting Kodi working with SMB. üòÑ</p>
