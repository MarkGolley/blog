<h1>Why I Set Up a Pi-hole and How I Got It Working</h1>
<p> This post is a simple guide to setting up a Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi. I'll explain what the Pi-hole does, how to install it, and how it can improve your network experience.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd read about the benefits of a Pi-hole and how it could reduce the number of ads I see across all my devices on Wi-Fi. I already use browser ad blockers, but I wanted to experiment with a Raspberry Pi‚Äîand this seemed like the perfect project!</p>

<p>Enter Pi-hole: a powerful little tool that runs as a local DNS server, blocking ads for every device on your network.</p>

<h2>Why I Got a Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Ads had become more intrusive than ever, especially on streaming services, YouTube, and certain websites. I wanted:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Faster browsing</strong> (if possible)</li>
    <li><strong>Fewer distractions</strong> ‚Äì yes please (haha)</li>
    <li><strong>More privacy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Some nerdy fun</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a spare Raspberry Pi 3 from a friend, so I decided to put it to work.</p>

<h2>The Network Flow</h2>
<p>Here's how network traffic flows after setting it up:</p>
<p><code>Device ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí Internet</code></p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>Before I could begin, I needed a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HDMI to Micro HDMI cable</li>
    <li>USB-A keyboard</li>
    <li>USB-A mouse ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have one, so it was keyboard-only!</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Does a Pi Connect?</h3>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt even sure if my Pi supported Wi-Fi. To find out, I ran:</p>
<pre><code>iwconfig</code></pre>
<p>I looked for <code>wlan0</code> in the output‚Äîand it was there! So Wi-Fi was a go.</p>

<h2>Installing Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Installation was simple with a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code></pre>
<p>I selected a few popular blocklists and configured Pi-hole to run on port 8080, since another service was already using port 80.</p>

<h3>Connecting Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>To get Wi-Fi working, I edited the network configuration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></pre>
<p>Then added:</p>
<pre class="blueprint">network={
    ssid="YourWiFiSSID"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword"
}</pre>
<p>After a quick reboot, I got the IP address using:</p>
<pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: Assign a static IP to your Pi using your router‚Äôs admin settings.
</div>

<h3>Telling the Router to Use the Pi-hole</h3>
<p>I logged into my router (the default IP and password were printed on the back), and changed the DNS settings from "automatic" to "manual". Then I entered the Pi‚Äôs IP address so it could handle DNS requests.</p>

<h4>What is DNS Resolution?</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs how your devices translate human-friendly domain names (like <code>bbc.co.uk</code>) into IP addresses. Pi-hole steps in here to block unwanted domains at this point in the process.</p>

<h2>Taking a Look at the Dashboard</h2>
<p>To access the dashboard, I visited:</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.1.XXX/admin</code></pre>
<p>It loaded‚Äîbut there was zero activity showing. Uh-oh. Here is what a working one looks like:</p>
<img src="./Posts/PostsImages/pi-dashboard.png" alt="Pi-hole dashboard showing blocked ads statistics" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">

<h2>Diagnosing Why It Was Inactive</h2>
<p>When I first accessed the Pi-hole dashboard at:</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.1.XXX/admin</code></pre>
<p>It loaded, but there was no activity showing‚Äîno blocked queries, nothing. This didn‚Äôt seem right. I had no idea where to start, but I decided to poke around and try to figure out what was going on. Here‚Äôs what I did:</p>

<h3>1. Is the Pi-hole Even Running?</h3>
<p>The first thing that popped into my head was, "Wait, is Pi-hole even doing anything right now?" I remembered something about "services" from when I installed it, so I ran:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status pihole-FTL.service</code></pre>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was looking for, to be honest‚Äîbut I saw the words "active (running)" in green. That was a relief! At least Pi-hole wasn‚Äôt completely broken. But why wasn‚Äôt it blocking anything?</p>

<h3>2. Is the Router Playing Along?</h3>
<p>Then I thought, "Maybe my devices aren‚Äôt even using the Pi-hole." I logged into my router (the IP address and login info were on the back of the device) and checked the DNS settings. It turns out I hadn‚Äôt actually saved the change to use the Pi-hole‚Äôs IP as the primary DNS server. Oops! I fixed that and hit save. And‚Ä¶ still nothing. Hmm.</p>

<h3>3. Testing DNS Queries</h3>
<p>At this point, I decided to see if the Pi-hole was getting ANY traffic at all. I ran this on my laptop:</p>
<pre><code>nslookup google.com</code></pre>
<p>The result was‚Ä¶ confusing. It showed my regular router‚Äôs IP address as the DNS, not the Pi-hole‚Äôs. That was when it hit me: I hadn‚Äôt double-checked that every device on the network was actually using the Pi-hole. Ugh, rookie mistake. Before moving on, I went into one device's network settings (my laptop) and manually set the DNS server to the Pi-hole‚Äôs IP. Then I ran <code>nslookup</code> again‚Äîand finally, it showed the Pi-hole‚Äôs IP!</p>

<h3>4. Did the Pi‚Äôs IP Change?</h3>
<p>By now, I was grasping at straws. I thought, "What if my Pi got a new IP address somehow?" Even though I *thought* I‚Äôd assigned a static IP in the router settings, I ran:</p>
<pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>
<p>Luckily, the Pi‚Äôs IP hadn‚Äôt changed. So at least that wasn‚Äôt the issue. But now I knew for sure that the DNS traffic wasn‚Äôt getting to the Pi in the first place. That narrowed my problem down to the network settings.</p>

<h3>What Finally Worked</h3>
<p>After fumbling through different settings and retries, I found out the router had some sneaky "backup DNS" settings that I hadn‚Äôt disabled. These let the router bypass my Pi-hole whenever it wanted! Once I disabled those and saved everything properly, things started working. I refreshed the Pi-hole dashboard and watched in amazement as blocked query numbers finally started climbing. A small victory!</p>

<h2>Making Devices Use Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I routed devices through it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Windows PC</strong>: Updated DNS manually in Ethernet settings</li>
    <li><strong>iPhone & Apple TV</strong>: Changed DNS under their Wi-Fi settings</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip">
    ‚úÖ Tip: It takes effect instantly‚Äîno need to reboot the device.
</div>

<p>Once configured, ads started vanishing across those devices.</p>

<h2>Blocklists and Limitations</h2>
<p>Out of the box, Pi-hole doesn‚Äôt block YouTube/ITVX etc ads. That‚Äôs not a bug‚Äîit‚Äôs because these services often serve content and ads from the same domains.</p>

<p>To strengthen Pi-hole, I added a few more URLs to the dashboards block list and updated the pi to use them with
<pre><code>pihole -g</code></pre>
<p>I added:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Firebog list collection</li>
    <li>Steven Black‚Äôs hosts file</li>
</ul>

<p>Even then, YouTube remains tricky‚ÄîDNS-level blocking has limits.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Setting up Pi-hole wasn‚Äôt totally smooth, but it was a fun and rewarding weekend project. I learned loads doing this!!</p>

<p>My internet is now cleaner, faster, and more private. If you‚Äôre comfortable using the terminal and enjoy a bit of tinkering, I‚Äôd absolutely recommend giving Pi-hole a go.</p>

<h2>Bonus Project: Turn Pi into a Media Server</h2>
<p>With Pi-hole sorted, I plugged in an external hard drive full of movies and photos. It auto-mounted, so I could browse the files straight away.</p>

<p>I set up Samba (SMB) to access them from my Windows PC. I‚Äôm now trying to use Kodi on my Xbox to stream the content. The only snag: the ‚ÄúWindows network‚Äù option isn‚Äôt showing up. Still working on that!</p>

<p>Let me know if you've had a similar experience‚Äîor any tips for getting Kodi working with SMB. üòÑ</p>
